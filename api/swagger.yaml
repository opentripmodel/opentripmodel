    # Introduction

    ## What is OpenTripModel?
    OpenTripModel is a simple, free (as in both “free speech” and “free beer”), lightweight and easy-to-use data model, used to exchange real-time logistic trip data on the web, and making it easier for shippers, carriers, software vendors, OEMs, and truck manufacturers to create new multi-brand application and services.

    OpenTripModel is currently used and implemented by over 20 carriers providing transport services to the largest retailer in the Netherlands and the Dutch postal service provider. OpenTripModel is initiated and developed by Simacan and currently used in the Simacan Control Tower, where it has been in production since early 2014.

    In order to speed up innovation in the market, Simacan decided to open up OpenTripModel specification for everyone to use, modify, and enrich. Ultimately, this will make it cheaper and easier for everyone in the logistics sector to exchange data, and develop and use new applications and services.

    ## OpenTripModel sponsors
    The [Platform Beter Benutten](http://www.beterbenutten.nl) project funds the open-source project related activities such as fine tuning and internationalising the documentation, the reference API, conduct extensive user evaluation and feedback sessions and the creation and maintenance of this website.

    # The model
    <iframe src="images/otm-model.svg" height="300" width="425" style="border:0px;"></iframe>

    OpenTripModel defines entities, displayed yellow in the image. The entities are:
      * **[Vehicle](/#tag/Vehicle)**: models any means in or by which someone travels or something is carried or conveyed. This means a vehicle can be a truck, a trailer, a train, an airplane or even some means of transport that is not invented yet. Vehicles can be coupled, thus a combination of a truck and a trailer are modeled in OTM as two coupled vehicles.
      * **[Location](/#tag/Location)**: models any location. Note that the term location is a bit deceptive. A location in OpenTripModel can also represent an area. Locations in OpenTripModel are only defined by their geograhic reference(s). Other references, such as street adresses, are modeled as 'administrative reference' and are treated as metadata.
      * **[Shipment](/#tag/Shipment)**: models an arbitrary amount of goods that are to be transported. OpenTripModel does not say anything about minimum or maximum sizes or amounts. This means that a shipment might be as small as a letter that is to be delivered at an office but also as large as a trailer full of goods that are to be delivered to e.g. a supermarket.
      * **[Route](/#tag/Route)**: A route describes _how_ a vehicle can move between two points. It is not much more than a (series of) georeferences.
      * **[Trip](/#tag/Trip)**: A trip models the idea that goods will be transported between two (or more) locations. A trip may me linked to a route. A trip entity itself does not contain much data, all details of a trip are modeled as events that are published on a trip entity.
      * **[Actor](/#tag/Actor)**: A `Actor` can represent a company or an indiviual.

    Apart from these entities, perhaps the most important entity in OpenTripModel is the **[Event](/#tag/Event)**. All dynamic behaviour is modeled as (a series of) event(s).

    ## Life cycle phases
    Apart from the entities described above, _life cycle phases_ are another important concept in OpenTripModel. There are three life cycle phases defined:
      * **planned**: this phase is all about planning. Events in this phase represent planned events; a _planning_ of a logistic operation can be modelled as a series of planned events in OpenTripModel. Planned events typically originate from a planning system.
      * **actual**: this phase models the reality that is happening at present time. As opposed to planned events, actual events typically originate from GPS tracking devices or traffic information systems.
      * **realized**: this phase can be used to view and analyze a logistic operation in retrospect. Events in this phases are recorded and archived events from the actual phase.

    The entities **Vehicle**, **Location**, **Shipment**, **Route**, **Trip** and **Actor** exist in all life cycle phases. Once defined in one life cycle phase, an entity does exist in all life cycle phases and has the same properties in all phases. The only thing that differs between phases are the **Events**. Events are always happening in one life cycle phase. However, events can be related between different life cycle phases. E.g. an _actual_ event can have a related event in the _planned_ phase.

    ## About IDs
    All objects used in the OpenTripModel API will be assigned a unique ID upon creation of the object. This ID will be an automatically generated UUID. The `id` field of an object will contain a full URI, that can be used to retrieve or update the object later. The generated UUID is part of this URI.

    description: |
      Locations are geometric entities which can have either the shape of a point or an area. These points and areas can be used to model delivery zones, shop and warehouse coordinates as well as environmental zones within urban areas, areas with access restrictions, etc.
  - name: Event
    description: |
      An event is something occurring at a specific time (whether in the past, present, or past alike) and (optionally) at a specific location. Events are the core of this API. Events link all static objects together. The table below shows which event types are applicable to which entities in the OpenTripModel.

        Retrieves a list of events on the Route, identified by its UUID. The behaviour of this call is slightly different, depending on the `lifecycle` phase:
        - **planned**: The `endDateTime` query parameter is mandatory. The `startDateTime` query parameter is optional; if it is ommitted, the default value is _now_. The returned list is a list of planned events on the route in the given time window, that are known at the time of the request.
        - **actual**: Both the `endDateTime` and `startDateTime` query parameters are mandatory. The returned list contains planned _and_ actual events on the given route, within the given time window.
        - **realized**: The `startDateTime` query parameter is mandatory. The `endDateTime` query parameter is optional; when ommitted, the default value is _now_. The returned list is a list of actual events that took place on the given route in the given time window.

####### Trips #######

  trip:
    type: object
    description: |
      Trip object. A trip object consists of a list of events and an optional route. The sequence of events defines the trip. Each trip has an associated `events` endpoint that can be used to get the events for this trip or to publish new events on the trip. A Trip object only exists in one single lifecycle phase. There can be linked trip objects in other lifecycle phases. E.g. a Trip in the `planned` phase can have a linked Trip object in the `actual` phase. The planned trip only has planned events, and the actual trip only has actuals events. The list of events on the actual trip will grow in time, as more actual events happen.

          The date and time this `Event` is estimated to happen. Note that this is not a planned time, but an estimated time, that is calculated based on previous events. This means that the `estimatedTime` might not be available at all times. E.g. if there are no previous events, not `estimatedTime` can be calculated. The exact meaning of this field depends on the `lifecyclePhase`:
          - `planned`: The estimated time may be calculated based on typical travel times. This can be helpful in validating or fine tuning a planning.
          - `actual`: The estimated time is calculated based on travel times that take into account current traffic conditions. Note that the estimated time can change often, based on various conditions.
          - `realized`: In realized there is no estimated time.

          - `https://opentripmodel.org/types/licensePlate/<countryCode>`, **License plate**: Licence plate identifier. Use the [international vehicle registration code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_vehicle_registration_codes) in the URI,
          - `https://opentripmodel.org/types/name`, **Name**: Just a name
          - `https://opentripmodel.org/types/kvknummer`, **Dutch Chamber of Commerce number**: Can be used to identify a company.
          - `http://www.gs1.org/gsin`, **GSIN**, [Global Shipment Identification Number](http://www.gs1.org/gsin) - identifies a shipment, according to the [GS1 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GS1).
          - `http://www.gs1.org/sscc`, **SSCC**, [Serial Shipping Container Code](http://www.gs1.org/sscc) - identifies a container within a shipment, in case a shipment consists of more than one container, according to the [GS1 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GS1).
          - `http://www.gs1.org/gtin`, **GTIN**, [Global Trade Item Number](http://www.gs1.org/gtin), identifies an item in an container within a shipment, according to the [GS1 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GS1).
          Note that the list above is just a list of examples. E.g. in case of shipments, OpenTripModel doesn't define the granularity of a Shipment, while the GS1-references might suggest otherwise. In GS1 terms, a Shipment in OpenTripModel can either be a Shipment, or a Shipping Container or a Trade Item or neither of those. It all depends on the needs of the logistics operation that is to be modeled in OpenTripModel.
        example: https://opentripmodel.org/types/licensePlate/nl
      value:
        type: string
        description: The unique identifier (ID) in the format defined by the schema.
