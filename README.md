# OpenTripModel.org OTM 4

This is the source code repository of the OTM 4 API Reference Documentation of
[OpenTripModel.org](https://opentripmodel.org). General information on
OpenTripModel can be found at
[opentripmodel.org](https://opentripmodel.org). The OTM 4
reference documentation that is generated out of this source code repository is
published at [developer.opentripmodel.org](https://developer.opentripmodel.org).

## What is OpenTripModel?

OpenTripModel is a simple, free, lightweight and easy-to-use data model, used to
exchange real-time logistic trip data on the web. It provides users a
standarised digital vocabulary to describe and exchange the information
**before**, **during** and **after** transport operations within a logistics
supply chain. Read more on the
[OpenTripModel.org website](https://opentripmodel.org).

## What is OTM 4?

OpenTripModel version 4 is an older version of OTM that became deprecated once
[OTM5](https://otm5.opentripmodel.org/) was formally released in 2020. If you are
a new user of OTM, we strongly advise you use OTM5. We keep the OTM 4 reference
documentation around only for users who need to keep supporting existing OTM 4
connections.

## What is in this repository?

This repository contains the OpenAPI specification for the OpenTripModel API in
YAML format.

The repository also includes redoc/index.html.

With these files and an installation of [Redoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc),
the documentation can be rendered in a human-readable fashion. We recommend you don't do that yourself and instead
refer to the version on [opentripmodel.org](https://opentripmodel.org).

## Important note about tagging releases

Every mainline and beta Git tag (such as `version/4.1.2` and `version/4.2.0-b5`) is automatically available on 
developer.opentripmodel.org. Please do not create a tag in this repository unless you want the new OTM4
version to be public.
